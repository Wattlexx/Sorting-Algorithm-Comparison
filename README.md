# Sorting-Algorithm-Comparison
Comparison between 3 different sorting algorithms. The program will take the numbers in the number.txt file and 
each sorting algorithm will create a new file containing the numbers sorted. Afterwards a new file comparisons.txt is created with the number
of iterations that each algorithm took to sort all the numbers.
